  <h3>Real-time store monitoring</h3>
  <h4>#databases</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/loopai" target="blank">Github link &#x29c9;</a> (ongoing)
  </h5>
  <p>Loopai monitors several restaurants in the US and needs to monitor if the store is online or not. All restaurants
    are supposed to be online during their business hours. Due to some unknown reasons, a store might go inactive for a
    few hours. Restaurant owners want to get a report of the how often this happened in the past. </p>
  <p>Build backend APIs that will help restaurant owners to achieve this goal.</p>
  <p>
    <b>System requirements</b> <br />

    - Do not assume that this data is static and precompute the answers as this data will keep getting updated every
    hour.<br />
    - You need to store these CSVs into a relevant database and make API calls to get the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>/trigger_report -> report_id (random string)</code> : endpoint that will trigger report generation from the
    data provided (stored in DB). <br />
    report_id will be used for polling the status of report completion.<br />

    <code>/get_report -> CSV | str</code> : endpoint that will return the status of the report or the csv. <br />
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>My ongoing work</b> <br />
    - since, the smallest unit for which we have to measure the availability is an hour.<br />
    - we divide menu_hours into batches of 1 hour for each day. (eg: 9AM to 12PM contains 3 batches).<br />
    - we look for available data in each of the batches.<br />
    - if the store was active we mark the whole hour as available. <br />
    - if the store was not active or the data is not available then we mark the whole hour as not available.<br />

  <h3>Can we solve wordle using math?</h3>
  <h4>#probability</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/wordle-app" target="blank">Github link &#x29c9;</a> (ongoing)
  </h5>
  <p>
    By leveraging <b>Grant Sandersonâ€™s</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA" target="blank">entropy
      concept &#x29c9;</a>, developing an AI that utilizes a corpus of <b>13,000</b> five-letter words, which can solve
    any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="blank">wordle &#x29c9;</a> game in no more
    than six attempts.
    The algorithm uses information theory & Probability to determine the optimal next word guess.<br />

  <h3>Building a computer from first principles</h3>
  <h4>#compilers #operarting_systems #computer_architecture</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/nand2tetris" target="blank">Github link &#x29c9;</a> (ongoing)
  </h5>
  <p>
    Following the guidelines at <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" target="blank">Nand2Tetris &#x29c9;</a>,
    implementing a fully functional computer from scratch (<b>software hierarchy</b> + <b>hardware platform</b>).<br />

    The hardware platform involves implementing the elementary logic gates using
    an <b>HDL</b>. Then, a <b>CPU</b>, and a <b>RAM</b> chip from combinational & sequential logic.<br />

    The software hierarchy involves implementing a <b>high-level language</b>, a
    <b>compiler</b>, a <b>Virtual Machine translator</b> to translate the compiled code to
    machine language, then an <b>assembler</b> to translate it to binary, and finally, a basic <b>operating system</b>
    that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform.<br />

  <h3>An AI that answers queries on documents</h3>
  <h4>#natural_language_processing</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week6/questions" target="blank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a></h5>
  <p>
    Built a question answering system similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson" target="blank">IBM
      Watson &#x29c9;</a>. It operates on a corpus of text documents and aims to find the most relevant documents and
    passages to a given query.<br />

    For document retrieval, the system uses <b>tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency)</b> to rank them based
    on the frequency of query terms and their overall importance in the corpus.<br />

    Passage retrieval is performed by subdividing the top document(s) into sentences. In scoring the passages, the
    system employs a combination of <b>inverse document frequency</b> and a <b>query term density</b> measure.<br />

  <h3>Implementing a Nim Strategist</h3>
  <h4>#reinforcement_learning</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week6/questions" target="blank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a></h5>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="blank">Nim &#x29c9;</a> is a game where players take turns
    removing objects from piles, and the player who removes the last object loses.<br />

    Developed an AI that gradually learns the optimal actions to take in different game states through <b>reinforcement
      learning</b>, specifically using <b>Q-learning</b> .<br />

    The Q-learning formula is used to update the Q-value for each (state, action) pair using the learning rate (alpha),
    which determines the weight given to new information, and the estimation of the current and future rewards.<br />

  <h3>How search engines rank pages?</h3>
  <h4>#probability</h4>
  <h5>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week2/pagerank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    Larry Page, one of the founders of Google, introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"
      target="_blank">PageRank algorithm &#x29c9;</a>, which was initially employed to determine the ranking of web
    pages within the <b>Google search</b> engine. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page
    to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is<br />

    I implemented a simplified version of the PageRank algorithm by two methods - by sampling pages from a <b>Markov
      Chain</b> random surfer and by iteratively applying the PageRank formula, where a random surfer navigates the web
    by randomly clicking on links with a certain <b>probability</b> or making random jumps with the <b>complementary
      probability</b>.

  <h3>Generating Crossword Puzzles using AI</h3>
  <h4>#knowledge_representation</h4>
  <h5>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week3/crossword">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword"> crossword puzzle &#x29c9;</a> is represented as
    a grid with variables representing the words to be filled in. Each variable has properties such as its position,
    direction, and length.<br />

    Implemented an AI to generate a crossword puzzle by solving a <b>CSP (constraint satisfaction problem)</b>. The goal
    is to find a word from a given list of words that satisfies both unary constraints (word length) and binary
    constraints (overlaps with neighboring variables) using <b>AC-3 algorithm</b>. Additionally, the AI ensures that all
    words used in the puzzle are different.

  <h3>AI that plays Minesweeper</h3>
  <h4>#knowledge_representation</h4>
  <h5>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week1/minesweeper">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minsweeper &#x29c9;</a> is a logic
    puzzle featuring a grid of clickable squares, with hidden mines scattered throughout the board. The objective is to
    clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each
    field.<br />

    Developed an AI that plays Minesweeper like a human, using the <b>CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)</b>
    algorithm. It creates constraints for each opened square and flagged mine, updating the knowledge base and resolving
    the equations accordingly.
