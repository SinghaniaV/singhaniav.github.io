  <h3>Building a computer from first principles</h3>
  <h4>#compilers #operarting_systems #computer_architecture</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/nand2tetris" target="blank">Github link &#x29c9;</a> (ongoing)
  </h5>
  <p>
    Following the guidelines at <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" target="blank">Nand2Tetris &#x29c9;</a>,
    implemented a fully functional computer from scratch (<b>software hierarchy</b> + <b>hardware platform</b>) capable of running high-level programming languages.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Key Phases:</b><br />

    - Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra: Begin by implementing basic logic gates, with a focus on the NAND gate, and explore the principles of Boolean algebra.<br />
    - Combinatorial Logic: Build more complex components such as adders and multiplexers using the basic logic gates, creating a foundation for the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).<br />
    - Memory: Develop memory units, including RAM and ROM, to store and retrieve information.<br />
    - Machine Language Programming: Create a machine language for the computer and build an assembler to transalate assembly code into binary.<br />
    - Virtual Machine: Design and implement a virtual machine that can transalate compiled code to machine language.<br />
    - High-Level Language: Develop a simple high-level programming language, and create a compiler.<br />
    - Operating System: Build a basic operating system that supports file handling, input/output, and process management.<br />
    - Assembler, Compiler, and Operating System Integration: Integrate the assembler, compiler, and operating system into the overall computer system.

  <h3>Implementing a BitTorrent client from scratch</h3>
  <h4>#computer_networks #distributed_systems</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/PyTorrent" target="blank">Github link &#x29c9;</a> <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsdq-3Z1EPT1rNeq2GXpnivaWINnOaCd0&si=m-joc6D6t13JWvtv" target="blank"> BitTorrent Internals &#x29c9;</a> (ongoing)

    </h5>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent" target="blank">BitTorrent &#x29c9;</a> client from scratch. BitTorrent is a popular <b>peer-to-peer</b> file sharing protocol that allows users to distribute and download large files efficiently. Building a client involves understanding the BitTorrent protocol, managing connections to multiple peers, downloading and uploading data in a distributed manner, and ensuring data integrity. <br />

    This project will help me develop a deep understanding of network protocols, peer-to-peer systems, and concurrent programming.<br />

  <h3>An AI that answers queries on documents</h3>
  <h4>#natural_language_processing</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week6/questions" target="blank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a></h5>
  <p>
    Built a question answering system similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson" target="blank">IBM Watson &#x29c9;</a>. It operates on a corpus of text documents and aims to find the most relevant documents and passages to a given query.<br />

    For document retrieval, the system uses <b>tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency)</b> to rank them based on the frequency of query terms and their overall importance in the corpus.<br />

    Passage retrieval is performed by subdividing the top document(s) into sentences. In scoring the passages, the system employs a combination of <b>inverse document frequency</b> and a <b>query term density</b> measure.<br />

  <h3>Implementing a Nim Strategist</h3>
  <h4>#reinforcement_learning</h4>
  <h5><a href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week6/questions" target="blank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a></h5>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="blank">Nim &#x29c9;</a> is a game where players take turns removing objects from piles, and the player who removes the last object loses.<br />

    Developed an AI that gradually learns the optimal actions to take in different game states through <b>reinforcement learning</b>, specifically using <b>Q-learning</b> .<br />

    The Q-learning formula is used to update the Q-value for each (state, action) pair using the learning rate (alpha), which determines the weight given to new information, and the estimation of the current and future rewards.<br />

  <h3>How search engines rank pages?</h3>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week2/pagerank">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    Larry Page, one of the founders of Google, introduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"
      target="_blank">PageRank algorithm &#x29c9;</a>, which was initially employed to determine the ranking of web pages within the <b>Google search</b> engine. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is<br />

    I implemented a simplified version of the PageRank algorithm by two methods - by sampling pages from a <b>Markov Chain</b> random surfer and by iteratively applying the PageRank formula, where a random surfer navigates the web by randomly clicking on links with a certain <b>probability</b> or making random jumps with the <b>complementary probability</b>.

  <h3>Generating Crossword Puzzles using AI</h3>
  <h4>#knowledge_representation</h4>
  <h5>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SinghaniaV/CS50-intro-to-ai/tree/master/week3/crossword">Github link
      &#x29c9;</a>
  </h5>

  <p>
    A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword"> crossword puzzle &#x29c9;</a> is represented as a grid with variables representing the words to be filled in. Each variable has properties such as its position, direction, and length.<br />

    Implemented an AI to generate a crossword puzzle by solving a <b>CSP (constraint satisfaction problem)</b>. The goal is to find a word from a given list of words that satisfies both unary constraints (word length) and binary constraints (overlaps with neighboring variables) using <b>AC-3 algorithm</b>. Additionally, the AI ensures that all words used in the puzzle are different.

  </h5>

  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minsweeper &#x29c9;</a> is a logic puzzle featuring a grid of clickable squares, with hidden mines scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.<br />

    Developed an AI that plays Minesweeper like a human, using the <b>CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)</b>
    algorithm. It creates constraints for each opened square and flagged mine, updating the knowledge base and resolving the equations accordingly.
